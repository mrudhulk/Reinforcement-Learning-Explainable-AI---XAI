## Overview

This project is a revision guide and conceptual code companion for understanding Reinforcement Learning from the ground up. It walks through the major paradigms in RL — from simple reward-based learning and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Actor-Critic methods. It also introduces Explainable AI (XAI) methods for making RL models more interpretable and trustworthy.

---

## Topics Covered

### 🔁 Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals
- **Learning from Feedback** — How agents decide to repeat or abandon actions based on reward signals
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDP)** — Formalizing the state-action-reward framework with a real-world customer example
- **Q-Learning** — Tabular Q-learning update rule with learning rate (`α`) and discount factor (`γ`)
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** — Neural network-based Q-value approximation using PyTorch
- **Actor-Critic Methods** — Separating policy (actor) and value estimation (critic) for more stable learning

### 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI) for RL
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** — Feature attribution for understanding what drives an RL agent's decisions
- **Safety Constraints** — Incorporating penalty-based safety into reward shaping
- **Explanation Evaluation** — Quantifying which features (demand, season, promotion) most influence decisions

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Reward Signal** | Scalar feedback that guides agent behavior |
| **State** | Representation of the environment at a given time (e.g., `active_customer`) |
| **Action** | Decision taken by the agent (e.g., `offer_upgrade`, `send_discount`) |
| **Q-Table** | Lookup table mapping state-action pairs to expected returns |
| **DQN** | Deep neural network that approximates the Q-function |
| **Actor** | Policy network that selects actions |
| **Critic** | Value network that evaluates how good the current state is |
| **SHAP Values** | Explains model predictions by attributing importance to each feature |
| **Safety Penalty** | Subtracts from reward when a constraint is violated |

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Run in Google Colab (Recommended)

Click the badge at the top of this README to open the notebook directly in Google Colab — no local setup required.

### Option 2: Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mrudhulk/Revise-Reinforcement-Learning.git
cd Revise-Reinforcement-Learning

# Install dependencies
pip install torch numpy shap jupyter

# Launch the notebook
jupyter notebook Revise_RL_and_XAI.ipynb
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

---

## Usage

The notebook is structured as a progressive learning guide. Each section includes:
- A **conceptual explanation** of the RL or XAI topic
- A **minimal code snippet** to lock in the idea
- Real-world framing (e.g., customer retention, demand forecasting)

You can run each cell independently to understand individual concepts, or run the entire notebook top-to-bottom for a full revision session.
